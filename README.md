This is the test suite repo for Weel

############################################################################################
When working as a QA Engineer at Weel you will be required to write automated tests to check core functionality is working as expected. In this challenge you will be delivering a small test suite for our signup flow.
You can access the first page of the signup flow here: https://app-moccona.letsweel.com/app/business-signup

Your challenge is to write an automated test suite that tests for the following acceptance criteria:
- The user should be able to enter a work email and valid password before pressing “Sign
up with email” and navigating to the /personal-info page.
- Each field should show an error message if they are unpopulated
- The email field should only accept valid work emails.
- You should not be able to sign up a user that you have already signed up.
- If either the password or email don’t meet the requirements, error messages should
show.
